{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "The duration of each game can vary depending on factors such as player experience, familiarity with the rules, and the speed of decision-making. Here is a general estimate of the average playtime for the games I recommended:\n\n1. Twilight Imperium: This is an epic game that usually takes around 4 to 8 hours to complete, although longer sessions are not uncommon, especially for first-time players or when using expansions.\n\n2. Terraforming Mars: On average, a game of Terraforming Mars takes around 2 to 3 hours. The game can take longer if players are new to the rules or if there are frequent analysis and strategic discussions.\n\n3. Gaia Project: Gaia Project typically takes around 2 to 4 hours to complete. Like other complex strategy games, the duration can vary depending on player experience and the decision-making speed of the group.\n\n4. Through the Ages: A game of Through the Ages generally takes around 2 to 4 hours, depending on the number of players. As with other deep strategy games, the playtime can increase if players are new to the game or if there is thoughtful planning involved.\n\n5. Agricola: The playtime for Agricola is usually around 1.5 to 2.5 hours. The game duration can depend on the number of players and how familiar they are with the mechanics.\n\nRemember, these are average playtime estimates, and the actual duration may vary. It's always a good idea to allocate some extra time for learning the rules and setting up the game."}
